JUnit 5 is the next generation of the popular JUnit testing framework for Java. It introduces several new features and improvements over JUnit 4, making it more powerful and flexible. Here are some of the key features of JUnit 5:1. Modular Architecture•JUnit 5 is composed of three main modules:•JUnit Platform: Provides the foundation for launching testing frameworks on the JVM.•JUnit Jupiter: Contains the new programming model and extension model for writing tests.•JUnit Vintage: Provides support for running JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 tests on the JUnit 5 platform.2. Annotations•New annotations are introduced, and some existing ones are enhanced:•@Test: Marks a method as a test method.•@BeforeEach and @AfterEach: Replaces @Before and @After from JUnit 4.•@BeforeAll and @AfterAll: Replaces @BeforeClass and @AfterClass from JUnit 4.•@DisplayName: Allows custom display names for test classes and methods.•@Nested: Enables nested test classes for better organization.•@ParameterizedTest: Supports parameterized tests with different input values.•@RepeatedTest: Allows a test to be repeated multiple times.•@Disabled: Replaces @Ignore from JUnit 4 to disable a test.3. Parameterized Tests•JUnit 5 provides built-in support for parameterized tests using the @ParameterizedTest annotation.•You can use various sources for parameters, such as:•@ValueSource•@CsvSource•@MethodSource•@EnumSource•@NullSource and @EmptySource4. Dynamic Tests•JUnit 5 introduces dynamic tests, which allow you to generate tests at runtime using the @TestFactory annotation.•This is useful for creating tests based on dynamic data or conditions.5. Conditional Test Execution•JUnit 5 provides annotations to conditionally execute tests based on certain conditions:•@EnabledOnOs and @DisabledOnOs: Enable/disable tests based on the operating system.•@EnabledIfSystemProperty and @DisabledIfSystemProperty: Enable/disable tests based on system properties.•@EnabledIfEnvironmentVariable and @DisabledIfEnvironmentVariable: Enable/disable tests based on environment variables.6. Extension Model•JUnit 5 introduces a powerful extension model that replaces the @Rule and @ClassRule mechanisms from JUnit 4.•Extensions can be used to customize test behavior, such as:•Dependency injection.•Test lifecycle callbacks.•Custom conditions for test execution.7. Assertions and Assumptions•Assertions: JUnit 5 includes a rich set of assertion methods in the Assertions class, including support for lambda expressions.•Assumptions: Assumptions allow you to skip tests if certain conditions are not met, using methods like assumeTrue() and assumeFalse().8. Test Interfaces and Default Methods•JUnit 5 allows you to define tests in interfaces using default methods.•This is useful for creating reusable test templates or mixins.9. Improved Display Names•The @DisplayName annotation allows you to give human-readable names to test classes and methods.•This improves the readability of test reports.10. Tagging and Filtering•You can tag tests using the @Tag annotation and then filter tests based on these tags during test execution.•This is useful for categorizing tests (e.g., "slow", "fast", "integration").11. Test Timeouts•JUnit 5 provides a @Timeout annotation to specify a timeout for a test method.•If the test exceeds the specified time, it fails.12. Custom Test Engines•JUnit 5 allows you to create custom test engines to support other testing frameworks or custom testing needs.13. Improved Exception Testing•JUnit 5 provides better support for testing exceptions using the assertThrows() method.14. Java 8+ Support•JUnit 5 leverages Java 8 features like lambda expressions, streams, and functional interfaces.15. Migration Support•JUnit Vintage ensures backward compatibility with JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 tests, making migration easier.Example Code Snippet:javaJUnit 5 is a modern and flexible testing framework that addresses many limitations of JUnit 4 and provides new features to make testing more efficient and expressive.
